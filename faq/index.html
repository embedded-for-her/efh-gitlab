				<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Resource people</h2></li>
				<li>
					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who are the resource people?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p>The resource people consist of the course instructors, guest speakers and project mentors. One group is not mutually exclusive of the other.</p>
					</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
				</li>

				<li>
					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who are course instructors?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p>The course instructors are the ones teaching the course in the first 5 weeks. These people develop embedded systems for a living. They have been through the entire life cycle of developing a product as a part of a crowdfunding campaign. And having been participants and speakers in multiple training programs, they have good experience in teaching an audience with a varied knowledge base.</p>
					</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
				</li>

				<li>
					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who are the guest people and what will they speak about?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p>The guest speakers are people from diverse backgrounds providing their unique insight right from freelancing, working with the maker community, being an author of technical books, starting a company and making stuff in general.</p>
					</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
				</li>
			</ul> <!-- cd-faq-group -->

			<ul id="selection" class="cd-faq-group">
				<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Selection</h2></li>
				<li>
					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the criteria for selection?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p> The following criteria would be assessed from the registration form entries and if required over a phone call.<br>
						• Motivation to do self-initiated, non-enforced projects in any field. This means projects that are not enforced by school, college or work.<br>
						• Commitment to stick through the entire program duration<br>
						• Interest in making stuff.<br>
						• Finally, interest in electronics and/or coding.
						</p>

				<li>
					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I'm a/an artist/engineer/student/home-maker/scientist/{anything}. Would this program be suitable for me?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p>While we start from the basics of embedded systems, we don't start from the absolute scratch. We will not tell you that a program executes sequentially line after line. If you have dabbled in coding before, you should be fine in applying for the program.<br>
						Men apply for a job when they meet only 60% of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100% of them (<a href="https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified">ref</a>). Please believe in yourself and apply if you are interested.</p>

				<li>
					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What can I do if I can't afford the 5000 Rs as the fee for the program?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p>Please mention your constraint when filling up the application form. We also want to know why you are interested in this program. We'll see what we can do to subsidise the cost for your participation.</p>

				<li>
					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What do you plan to do with the information that I submit in the application form?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p>We only use the information received in the application form to select the candidates for the program. We will not share this information with any external entities.</p>

				<li>
					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I will not be able to attend on a particular date. Would this be a problem?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p>Please do try to attend all the class, especially the first five classes where the primary learning happens. Missing a session during the project work may be possible, depending on the coordination with your teammates.</p>

				<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Location</h2></li>
				<li>
					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Where is the venue for this program?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p>The program will not be held in a fixed location. We will use a variety of start-ups, makerspaces and community centres. This is to provide the participants with greater exposure, create opportunities to network and to discover new projects. The exact locations will be communicated to the selected participants.</p>
					</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
				</li>
				<li>
					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I am not from Bengaluru. Can I still register for the program?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p>Yes. Just make sure that you can be in Bengaluru on Saturdays from June 10th to August 12th. We cannot help you with the accommodation.</p>

				<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Certification</h2></li>
				<li>
					<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is it a certification program? What will I get after completion of the program?</a>
					<div class="cd-faq-content">
						<p>No. We believe that whatever project you take up and complete in this program will speak much much more than a piece of paper. The blog posts and videos of your project will shine like no certificate in your portfolio.</p>
